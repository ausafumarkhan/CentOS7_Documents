############################ NFS Configuration in CentOS 7 ##########################

NFS Server
1. Check the NFS is installed or not

	rpm -qa | grep -i nfs

2. If not, install it

	yum install nfs-* -y

3. Start or Restart the services

	systemctl start rpcbind
	systemctl start nfs
	
4. Enable the service on booting

	systemctl enable rpcbind
	systemctl enable nfs

5. Check the status of the port

	netstat -tulpn | grep -i 2049

6. Edit the major file of NFS

	vi /etc/exports
   Add the NFS directory that to be shared:
	/opt/funny	*(sync)

7. Excutes the following commands

	exportfs -rv
	exportfs -v

8. Find the IP address of the server

	ip r l


NFS Client

1. Ping the server from client

	ping <server_ip>

2. Check the connections from client to server via nfs port

	telnet <server_ip> 2049
	
	if, getting error, stop the firewall at the server side using
	
	systemctl stop firewalld

3. To check server's shared folder

	showmount -e <server_ip>

4. Create the folder at the cleint to mount server's shared folder

	mkdir <client_folder>

	mount <server_ip>:<server's folder path> <client's folder>

5. Persist the mount in /etc/fstab

	<server_ip>:<server's folder path> <client's folder> nfs defaults 0 0 

6. Check the files at the client 

	ls <cleint's folder>


Note: Always try to use hostname instead of server's IP address.

################## Congratulations......!!!!!! We have successfully configured NFS service in centOS 7 ############


NFS Options
Some other options we can use in “/etc/exports” file for file sharing is as follows.

ro: With the help of this option we can provide read only access to the shared files i.e client will only be able to read.
rw: This option allows the client server to both read and write access within the shared directory.
sync: Sync confirms requests to the shared directory only once the changes have been committed.
no_subtree_check: This option prevents the subtree checking. When a shared directory is the subdirectory of a larger file system, nfs performs scans of every directory above it, in order to verify its permissions and details. Disabling the subtree check may increase the reliability of NFS, but reduce security.
no_root_squash: This phrase allows root to connect to the designated directory.
For more options with “/etc/exports“, you are recommended to read the man pages for export.
