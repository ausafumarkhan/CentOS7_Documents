################# SOURCE CODE INSTALLATION IN CENTOS 7 ############################################

Using Source code Installation There were Six steps have to follow.

1. Download 
            Download the required packages and source code from repositories
2. Extract
           Extract the source code using tar and zip command
3. Configure
           Configure the apache using ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
           PREFIX must be replaced with the filesystem path under which the server should be installed. If PREFIX is not specified, it defaults to /usr/local/apache2
4. Compile and install:
            Make and make install cmd use to compile and install apache
5. Customize:
             vim /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service
6. Test:
            To check httpd running or not using commands if working then check in browser.



Installation process:

1. Run the below command which is used to install all the required packages for the  source code compilation of apache
       
      	# yum groupinstall " Development Tools"  -y

	Where "y" is the option for yes to install packages continue in installation. Using y option it cannot ask yes or no

2: install pcre and pcre-devel packages it is also required for the apache installation

	PCRE-Perl Compatible Regular Expressions

	# yum install expat-devel pcre pcre-devel openssl-devel -y

3: Download the apache source code along with apr and apr-util from apache website or git repository

	Apache httpd - https://github.com/apache/httpd/releases

	Apr - https://github.com/apache/apr/releases

	Apr-util - https://github.com/apache/apr-util/releases

To get an apache source code from the repository using "Wget" command to get the source code 


	# wget https://github.com/apache/httpd/archive/2.4.28.tar.gz -O httpd-2.4.28.tar.gz

	# wget https://github.com/apache/apr/archive/1.6.2.tar.gz -O apr-1.6.2.tar.gz

	# wget https://github.com/apache/apr-util/archive/1.6.0.tar.gz -O apr-util-1.6.0.tar.gz

4: Extract the downloaded source code

	# tar -xzf httpd-2.4.28.tar.gz
	# tar -xzf apr-1.6.2.tar.gz
	# tar -xzf apr-util-1.6.0.tar.gz

5: We need to place apr,apr-util directory to inside the srclib directory  it is located under HTTPD directory

	# mv apr-1.6.2 httpd-2.4.28/srclib/apr
	# mv apr-util-1.6.0 httpd-2.4.28/srclib/apr-util

6: change directory to httpd-2.4.28( which version u installed u can go to that directory)

	# cd httpd-2.4.28


Compilation of Apache source:

step7: To build a configure script, execute the following buildconf script file as follows.

	# ./buildconf 

Step8: Run the configuration command 
           We  Can change the default Apache installation directory path

	Here path will be /usr/local/apache2 directory path. 

	# ./configure --enable-ssl --enable-so --with-mpm=event --with-included-apr --prefix=/usr/local/apache2

Step9: Execute the make command to prepare the files for the installation of Apache.

	# make

step10: Execute the make install command to install Apache in it' s appropriate directory.

	# make install

Step 11:Now the Apache is successfully installed on the server from it' s source code. Next, run the httpd -v command to check Apache' s version. An error may appear as shown below.

	# httpd -v
	bash: httpd: command not foundâ€¦

step12: To remove that error, create an HTTPD command manually. Create a script file for httpd command under /etc/profile.d/ directory. Enter the following line in the file and save it.

	# vim /etc/profile.d/httpd.sh
	pathmunge /usr/local/apache2/bin

Step13: The file has been created, now logout from the current session and re-login to reload the profile. Check the Apache version by running the following command

	# httpd -v
	Server version: Apache/2.4.28 (Unix)
	Server built:   Oct 13 2017 23:23:07

Step14: Create an init script for managing httpd service. So create a httpd file under /etc/init.d/ directory using vim editor and make the following changes in the file. Save and exit the file.

	# vim /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service

	Unit]
	Description=The Apache HTTP Server
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	Type=forking
	ExecStart=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -k start
	ExecReload=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -k graceful
	ExecStop=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -k graceful-stop
	PIDFile=/usr/local/apache2/logs/httpd.pid
	PrivateTmp=true

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

Step15: reload the system deamon

	# systemctl daemon-reload

Step16: start and enable and checking the status of the apache httpd service 

	# systemctl start httpd
	# systemctl enable httpd
	Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service to /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.
	# systemctl status httpd

Step17: switch to browser type the localhost IP now loading the webpage using apache webserver.

	It will show the apache welcome page. 

	Thus we conclude the installation and configuration of Apache from its Source Code on CentOS 7.
