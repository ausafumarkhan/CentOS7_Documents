----------------------------- Tomcat Installation in CentOS 8/7------------------

Step 1: Installing and Configuring Java

	Before heading up for the Tomcat installation, make sure you must have JAVA installed on your Linux box to run Tomcat.
	If not, install the latest version of JAVA or use the following yum command to install available Java from the default repositories.
	
	# yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

	or
	
	# yum install java-11-openjdk-devel

	Once Java installed, you can verify the newly installed JAVA version running the following command on your system.

	# java -version

Step 2:Installing Apache Tomcat 9

	After installing JAVA on the system, now it’s time to download the latest version of Apache Tomcat.
	Check the latest version of Tomcat: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi

	Now download the latest version of Apache Tomcat 9, using following wget command and set up it

	# cd /usr/local
	# wget https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.37/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.37.tar.gz
	# tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.37.tar.gz
	# mv apache-tomcat-9.0.37.tar.gz tomcat9

	Note: Replace the version number above with the latest version available if it was different.

	Before starting the Tomcat Service, configure a CATALINA_HOME environment variable in your system using the following command.
	
	# echo "export CATALINA_HOME="/usr/local/tomcat9"" >> ~/.bashrc
	# source ~/.bashrc


	Now we all set to start the tomcat web server using the scripts provided by the tomcat package.

	# cd /usr/local/tomcat9/bin
	# ./startup.sh 
	
	Now to open Tomcat from your browser, go to your IP or domain with the 8080 port (because Tomcat will always run on the 8080 port) as an example: mydomain.com:8080, replace mydomain.com with your IP or domain.
	
	http://Your-IP-Address:8080
	OR
	http://Your-Domain.com:8080

	The default directory for Tomcat files will be in /usr/local/tomcat9, you can view the configuration files inside the conf folder, 
	when you open your website on the 8080 port is in /usr/local/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/.

Step 3: Configuring Apache Tomcat 9

	By default you only able to access the default Tomcat page, to access admin and other sections like Server Status, Manager App and Host Manager. 
	You need to configure user accounts for admins and managers.

	To do so, you need to edit the ‘tomcat-users.xml‘ file located under /usr/local/tomcat9/conf directory.
	
	
	Setup Tomcat User Accounts:
	
	For example, to assign the manager-gui role to a user named ‘tecmint‘ with a password ‘t$cm1n1‘, add the following line of code to the config file inside the section.
	
	# vi /usr/local/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml 
	
	<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
	<user username="tecmint" password="t$cm1n1" roles="manager-gui"/>

	Similarly, you can also add an ‘admin-gui‘ role to an admin user named ‘admin‘ with a password ‘adm!n‘ as shown below.

	<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
	<user username="admin" password="adm!n" roles="admin-gui"/>

	
	Enable Remote Access to Tomcat:

	By default, access to the Manager and Host Manager section is restricted to the localhost only, to allow access to these pages, you need to mention IP address or network range in a configuration file.
	
	# vi /usr/local/tomcat9/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
	
	Then look for the following line and change it to this to allow tomcat access from IP address 192.168.56.10.
	
	allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 |192.168.56.10" />

	You can also allow tomcat access from the local network 192.168.56.0.
	
	allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 |192.168.56.*" /gt;


	After setting up the admin and manager’s roles, restart the Tomcat and then try to access the admin section.

	# ./shutdown.sh 
	# ./startup.sh

	Now click on the ‘Server Status‘ tab, it will prompt you to enter user credentials, enter username and password that you’ve added above in the config file.

	Changing Apache Tomcat Port:
	If you want to run Tomcat on different port say 80 port. You will have to edit the ‘server.xml‘ file in ‘/usr/local/tomcat9/conf/‘. Before changing, port, make sure to stop the Tomcat server using.

	# /usr/local/tomcat9/bin/shutdown.sh

	Now open the server.xml file using the Vi editor
	
	# vi /usr/local/tomcat9/conf/server.xml

	Now search for “Connector port” and change its value from 8080 to 80 or any other port you want as it follows.

	To save the file and restart the Apache Tomcat server again, using the below command.
	
	# /usr/local/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh

	Of course, you have to run all the above commands as a root, if you don’t they won’t work because we are working on the ‘/usr/local‘ directory 
	which is a folder owned by the root user only if you want you can run the server as a normal user but you will have to use your HOME folder as 
	a working area to download, extract and run the Apache Tomcat server.

	To get some information about your running Tomcat server and your computer, run.
	
	/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/version.sh
